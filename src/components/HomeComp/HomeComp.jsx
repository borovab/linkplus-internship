           How this app is built
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          - The app is built with <strong>React</strong> and uses{" "}
          <strong>React Router DOM</strong> for navigation between pages.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          - Instead of Redux, state management is handled with{" "}
          <strong>Context API</strong> for a simpler and cleaner approach.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          - The UI is a mix of styles: some components are built with{" "}
          <strong>pure CSS</strong>, while others leverage{" "}
          <strong>Material UI</strong> for a modern look and feel.
        </Typography>
           <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          - The app includes full <strong>CRUD functionality</strong>: you can{" "}
          <strong>add</strong>, <strong>edit</strong>, and <strong>delete</strong>{" "}
          users dynamically.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          - Newly added users are also saved in <strong>LocalStorage</strong>,
          so data will persist even after a page refresh.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          - The project follows a <strong>clean folder structure</strong> for
          easier navigation and scalability.
        </Typography>
           <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          - The app is <strong>deployed on Vercel</strong> for testing purposes,
          making it accessible online with just a link.
        </Typography>
